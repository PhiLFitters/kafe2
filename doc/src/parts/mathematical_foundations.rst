This section briefly covers the underlying theoretical concepts 
upon which parameter estimation -and by extension *kafe2*- is based.

Basic notions
=============


Measurements and theoretical models
-----------------------------------

When measuring observable quantities, the results typically
consist of a series of numeric measurement values: the **data**.
Since no measurement is perfect, the data will be subject to 
**measurement uncertainties**. These uncertainties, also known
as errors, are unavoidable and can be divided into two subtypes:

**Statistical uncertainties**, also called random uncertainties,
are caused because of independent random fluctuations in the
measurement values, either because of technical limitations of
the experimental setup (electronic noise, mechanical vibrations)
or because of the intrinsic statistical nature of the measured
observable (as is typical in quantum mechanics, e. g. radioactive
decays).

When a measurement is performed more than once, the statistical
uncertainty of the average of the single measurements will
be smaller than those of each individial measurement.

**Systematic uncertainties** arise due to effects that
distort all measurements in the same way. Such uncertainties can
for example be caused by a random imperfection of the measurement
device, which affect all measurements in the same way, and hence
the uncertainties of all measurements taken with the same device
are no longer uncorrelated, but have one common uncertainty.
As a consequence, repeating a measurement will **not**
reduce the uncertainty of the end result. 

In most cases, measurements are affected by independent and by
correlated errors. In order to make meaningful quantitative
statements based on measurement data it is essential to quantify
both components of all uncertainties, expressed in terms of
their covariance matrix, or by the uncertainties and
their correlation matrix. 


Parameter estimation
--------------------

In **parameter estimation**, the main goal is to obtain
best estimates for the parameters of a theoretical model
by comparing the model predictions to experimental measurements.

This is typically done systematically by defining a quantity which 
expresses how well the model predictions fit the available data.
This quantity is commonly called the *loss function*, or the 
**cost function** (the term used in *kafe2* ). A statistical
interpretation is possible if the cost function is related
to the **likelihood** of the data with respect to a given
model. In many cases the method of **least squares** is used,
which is a special case of a likelihood for gaussian uncertainties.

The value of a cost function depends on the measurement data,
the model function (often derived as a prediction from an
underlying hypothesis of theory), and the uncertainties of
the measurements and, possibly, the model. Cost functions are
designed in such a way that the agreement between the measurements
:math:`d_i` and the corresponding predictions :math:`m_i` provided
by the model is **best** when the cost function reaches its
**global minimum**.

For a given experiment the data :math:`\textbf{d}` and the parametric
form of the model :math:`\textbf{m}` describing the data are constant.
This means that the cost function :math:`C` then only depends on the
model parameters, denoted here as a vector :math:`\textbf{p}` in
parameter space.

.. math::

    C = C\left(\textbf{d}, \textbf{m}(\textbf{p})\right) =  C(\textbf{p})

Therefore parameter estimation essentially boils down to finding the
vector of model parameters :math:`\hat{\textbf{p}}` for which the cost
function :math:`C(\textbf{p})` is at its global minimum.
In general this is a multidimensional optimization problem which is
typically solved numerically. There are several algorithms and tools
that can be used for this task:
In *kafe2* the Python package *SciPy* can be used to minimize cost
functions via its ``scipy.optimize`` module.
Alternatively,  *kafe2* can use the *MINUIT* implementations *TMinuit*
or *iminuit* when they are installed.
More information on how to use the Minimizers can be found in the :ref:`User Guide <minimizers>`.


Choosing a cost function
------------------------

There are many cost functions used in statistics for estimating
parameters. In physics experiments two are of particular importance:
the **sum of residuals** and the  **negative logarithm of the likelihood**,
which are used in the **least squares** or the **maximum likelihood** methods,
respectively. Incidentally, these are also the two basic types of cost functions that
have been implemented in *kafe2*.


.. _least-squares:

Least-squares ("chi-squared")
-----------------------------

The method of **least squares** is the standard approach in parameter estimation.
To calculate the value of this cost function the differences between model and
data are squared, then their sum is minimized with respect to
the parameters (hence the name '*least squares*').
More formally, using the data **covariance matrix** :math:`V`, the cost
function is expressed as follows:

.. math::

    \chi^2(\textbf{p}) = (\textbf{d} - \textbf{m}(\textbf{p}))^T \ V^{-1} \ (\textbf{d} - \textbf{m}(\textbf{p})).

Since the value of the cost function at the minimum follows a :math:`\chi^2`
distribution, and therefore the method of least squares is also known as
**chi-squared** method.
If the uncertainties of the data vector :math:`\textbf{d}` are uncorrelated,
all elements of :math:`V` except for its diagonal elements :math:`\sigma_i^2`
(the squares of the :math:`i`-th point-wise measurement uncertainties) vanish.

The above formula then simply becomes

.. math::

    \chi^2 = \sum_i \left( \frac{d_i - m_i(\textbf{p})}{\sigma_i} \right)^2.

All that is needed in this simple case is to divide the difference between
data :math:`d_i` and model :math:`m_i` by the corresponding uncertainty :math:`\sigma_i`.

Computation-wise there is no noticeable difference for small datasets
(:math:`O(100)` data points). For very large datasets, however, the inversion
of the full covariance matrix takes significantly longer than simply dividing
by the point-wise uncertainties.


.. _negative-log-likelihood:

Negative log-likelihood
-----------------------

The method of **maximum likelihood** attempts to find the best estimation for
the model parameters :math:`\textbf{p}` by maximizing the probability with
which such model parameters (under the given uncertainties) would result in the
observed data :math:`\textbf{d}`.
More formally, the method of maximum likelihood searches for those values of
:math:`\textbf{p}` for which the so-called **likelihood function** of the
parameters (**likelihood** for short) reaches its global maximum.

Using the probability of making a certain measurement given some values of
model parameters :math:`P(\textbf{p})` the likelihood function can be defined
as follows:

.. math::

    L(\textbf{p}) = \prod_i P_i(\textbf{p}).

However, usually parameter estimation is not performed by using the
likelihood, but by using its negative logarithm, the so-called
**negative log-likelihood**:

.. math::

    \log nlL(\textbf{p}) = -\log \left( \prod_i P_i(\textbf{p}) \right) = \sum_i \log P_i(\textbf{p}).

This transformation is allowed because logarithms are
**strictly monotonically increasing functions**, and therefore
the negative logarithm of any function will have
its global minimum at the same place where the likelihood is maximal.
The parameter values :math:`\textbf{p}` that minimize the negative log-likelihood will
therefore also maximize the likelihood.

While the above transformation may seem nonsensical at first, there are
important advantages to calculating the negative log-likelihood over
the likelihood:

-   The **product** of the probabilities :math:`\prod_i P_i` is replaced
    by a **sum** over the logarithms of the probabilities :math:`\sum_i \log P_i`.
    This is a numerical advantage because sums can be calculated much more
    quickly than products, and sums are numerically more stable than
    products of many small numbers.

-   Because the probabilities :math:`P_i` are oftentimes proportional
    to exponential functions, calculating their logarithm is actually
    **faster** because it reduces the number of necessary operations.

-   Taking the negative logarithm allows for always using the same numerical
    optimizers to **minimize** the cost funtions.

As an example, let us look at the negative log-likelihood of data with
uncertainties that assume a normal distribution:

.. math::

    -\log P(\textbf{p})
    = - \log \prod_i \frac{1}{\sqrt[]{2 \pi} \: \sigma_i} \exp\left(
    \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d_i - m_i(\textbf{p})}{\sigma_i} \right)^2\right)
    = - \sum_i \log \frac{1}{\sqrt[]{2 \pi} \: \sigma_i} + \sum_i \frac{1}{2}
    \left( \frac{d_i - m_i(\textbf{p})}{\sigma_i} \right)^2
    = - \log L_\mathrm{max} + \frac{1}{2} \chi^2

As we can see the logarithm cancels out the exponential function of the normal
distribution and we are left with two parts:

The first is a constant part that is represented by :math:`-\log L_\mathrm{max}`.
This is the minimum value the neg log-likelihood could possibly take on if the
model :math:`\textbf{m}` were to exactly fit the data :math:`\textbf{d}`.

The second part can be summed up as :math:`\frac{1}{2} \chi^2`.
As it turns the method of least squares is a special case of the method
of maximum likelihood where all data points have normally distributed uncertainties.
