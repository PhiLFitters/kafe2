**********************
Theoretical Foundation

This section briefly covers the underlying theoretical concepts
upon which parameter estimation – and by extension *kafe2* – is based.


Measurements and theoretical models
===================================

When measuring observable quantities, the results typically
consist of a series of numeric measurement values: the **data**.
Since no measurement is perfect, the data will be subject to 
**measurement uncertainties**. These uncertainties, also known
as errors, are unavoidable and can be divided into two subtypes:

**Independent uncertainties**, as the name implies, affect each measurement independently:
there is no relationship between the uncertainties of any two individual data points.
Independent uncertainties are frequently caused by random fluctuations in the measurement values,
either because of technical limitations of the experimental setup (electronic noise, mechanical
vibrations) or because of the intrinsic statistical nature of the measured observable (as is typical
in quantum mechanics, e. g. radioactive decays).

**Correlated uncertainties** arise due to effects that distort multiple measurements in the same
way.
Such uncertainties can for example be caused by a random imperfection of the measurement device
which affects all measurements in the same way.
The uncertainties of the measurements taken with such a device are no longer uncorrelated, but
instead have one common uncertainty.

Historically uncertainties have been divided into *statistical* and *systematic* uncertainties.
While this is appropriate when propagating the uncertainties of the input variables by hand it is
not a suitable distinction for a numerical fit.
In *kafe2* multiple uncertainties are combined to construct a so-called **covariance matrix**.
This is a matrix with the pointwise data *variances* on its diagonal and the *covariances* between
two data points outside the diagonal.
By using this covariance matrix for our fit we can estimate the uncertainty of our model parameters
numerically with no need for propagating uncertainties by hand.


Parameter estimation
====================

In **parameter estimation**, the main goal is to obtain
best estimates for the parameters of a theoretical model
by comparing the model predictions to experimental measurements.

This is typically done systematically by defining a quantity which 
expresses how well the model predictions fit the available data.
This quantity is commonly called the *loss function*, or the 
**cost function** (the term used in *kafe2* ). A statistical
interpretation is possible if the cost function is related
to the **likelihood** of the data with respect to a given
model. In many cases the method of **least squares** is used,
which is a special case of a likelihood for gaussian uncertainties.

The value of a cost function depends on the measurement data,
the model function (often derived as a prediction from an
underlying hypothesis or theory), and the uncertainties of
the measurements and, possibly, the model. Cost functions are
designed in such a way that the agreement between the measurements
:math:`d_i` and the corresponding predictions :math:`m_i` provided
by the model is **best** when the cost function reaches its
**global minimum**.

For a given experiment the data :math:`\bm{d}` and the parametric
form of the model :math:`\bm{m}` describing the data are constant.
This means that the cost function :math:`C` then only depends on the
model parameters, denoted here as a vector :math:`\bm{p}` in
parameter space.

.. math::

    C = C\left(\bm{d}, \bm{m}(\bm{p})\right) =  C(\bm{p})

Therefore parameter estimation essentially boils down to finding the
vector of model parameters :math:`\hat{\bm{p}}` for which the cost
function :math:`C(\bm{p})` is at its global minimum.
In general this is a multidimensional optimization problem which is
typically solved numerically. There are several algorithms and tools
that can be used for this task:
In *kafe2* the Python package :py:mod:`scipy` can be used to minimize cost
functions via its :py:mod:`scipy.optimize` module.
Alternatively, *kafe2* can use the *MINUIT* implementations *TMinuit*
or :py:mod:`iminuit` when they are installed.
More information on how to use the minimizers can be found in the :ref:`User Guide <minimizers>`.


Choosing a cost function
------------------------

There are many cost functions used in statistics for estimating
parameters. In physics experiments two are of particular importance:
the **sum of residuals** and the  **negative logarithm of the likelihood**,
which are used in the **least squares** or the **maximum likelihood** methods,
respectively. Incidentally, these are also the two basic types of cost functions that
have been implemented in *kafe2*.


.. _least-squares:

Least-squares ("chi-squared")
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The method of **least squares** is the standard approach in parameter estimation.
To calculate the value of this cost function the differences between model and
data are squared, then their sum is minimized with respect to
the parameters (hence the name '*least squares*').
More formally, using the data **covariance matrix** :math:`V`, the cost
function is expressed as follows:

.. math::

    \chi^2(\bm{p}) = (\bm{d} - \bm{m}(\bm{p}))^T \ V^{-1}
        \ (\bm{d} - \bm{m}(\bm{p})).

Since the value of the cost function at the minimum follows a :math:`\chi^2`
distribution, and therefore the method of least squares is also known as
**chi-squared** method.
If the uncertainties of the data vector :math:`\bm{d}` are uncorrelated,
all elements of :math:`V` except for its diagonal elements :math:`\sigma_i^2`
(the squares of the :math:`i`-th point-wise measurement uncertainties) vanish.

The above formula then simply becomes

.. math::

    \chi^2 = \sum_i \left( \frac{d_i - m_i(\bm{p})}{\sigma_i} \right)^2.

All that is needed in this simple case is to divide the difference between
data :math:`d_i` and model :math:`m_i` by the corresponding uncertainty :math:`\sigma_i`.

Computation-wise there is no noticeable difference for small datasets
(:math:`O(100)` data points). For very large datasets, however, the inversion
of the full covariance matrix takes significantly longer than simply dividing
by the point-wise uncertainties.


.. _negative-log-likelihood:

Negative log-likelihood
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The method of **maximum likelihood** attempts to find the best estimation for
the model parameters :math:`\bm{p}` by maximizing the probability with
which such model parameters (under the given uncertainties) would result in the
observed data :math:`\bm{d}`.
More formally, the method of maximum likelihood searches for those values of
:math:`\bm{p}` for which the so-called **likelihood function** of the
parameters (**likelihood** for short) reaches its global maximum.

Using the probability of making a certain measurement given some values of
model parameters :math:`P(\bm{p})` the likelihood function can be defined
as follows:

.. math::

    L(\bm{p}) = \prod_i P_i(\bm{p}).

However, usually parameter estimation is not performed by using the
likelihood, but by using its negative logarithm, the so-called
**negative log-likelihood**:

.. math::

    - \log L(\bm{p}) &= -\log \left( \prod_i P_i(\bm{p}) \right) \\
    &= \sum_i \log P_i(\bm{p}).

This transformation is allowed because logarithms are
**strictly monotonically increasing functions**, and therefore
the negative logarithm of any function will have
its global minimum at the same place where the likelihood is maximal.
The parameter values :math:`\bm{p}` that minimize the negative log-likelihood will
therefore also maximize the likelihood.

While the above transformation may seem nonsensical at first, there are
important advantages to calculating the negative log-likelihood over
the likelihood:

-   The **product** of the probabilities :math:`\prod_i P_i` is replaced
    by a **sum** over the logarithms of the probabilities :math:`\sum_i \log P_i`.
    This is a numerical advantage because sums can be calculated much more
    quickly than products, and sums are numerically more stable than
    products of many small numbers.

-   Because the probabilities :math:`P_i` are oftentimes proportional
    to exponential functions, calculating their logarithm is actually
    **faster** because it reduces the number of necessary operations.

-   Taking the negative logarithm allows for always using the same numerical
    optimizers to **minimize** different cost functions.

As an example, let us look at the negative log-likelihood of data with
uncertainties that assume a normal distribution:

.. math::

    -\log \prod_i P_i(\bm{p})
    & = - \log \prod_i \frac{1}{\sqrt[]{2 \pi} \: \sigma_i} \exp\left(
    \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d_i - m_i(\bm{p})}{\sigma_i} \right)^2\right) \\
    & = - \sum_i \log \frac{1}{\sqrt[]{2 \pi} \: \sigma_i} + \sum_i \frac{1}{2}
    \left( \frac{d_i - m_i(\bm{p})}{\sigma_i} \right)^2 \\
    & = - \log L_\mathrm{max} + \frac{1}{2} \chi^2

As we can see the logarithm cancels out the exponential function of the normal
distribution and we are left with two parts:

The first is a constant part that is represented by :math:`-\log L_\mathrm{max}`.
This is the minimum value the neg log-likelihood could possibly take on if the
model :math:`\bm{m}` were to exactly fit the data :math:`\bm{d}`.

The second part can be summed up as :math:`\frac{1}{2} \chi^2`.
As it turns the method of least squares is a special case of the method
of maximum likelihood where all data points have normally distributed uncertainties.


Handling uncertainties
----------------------

Standard cost functions treat fit data as a series of measurements in the *y* direction and can
directly make use of the corresponding uncertainties in the *y* direction.
Unfortunately uncertainties in the *x* direction cannot be used directly.
However, *x* uncertainties can be turned into *y* uncertainties by multiplying them with the
derivative of the model function to project them onto the *y* axis; this is what *kafe2* does.
The *xy* covariance matrix is then calculated as follows:

.. math::

    \bm{V}_{ij} = \bm{V}_{y,ij} + f'\left(x_i\right)f'\left(x_j\right)\bm{V}_{x,ij}.

.. warning::
    This procedure is only accurate if the model function is approximately linear on the scale of
    the *x* uncertainties.


Other types of uncertainties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As the statistical uncertainty for histograms is a Poisson distribution for the number of entries in
each bin, a negative log-likelihood cost function with a Poisson probability can be used, where
:math:`{\bf d}` are the measurements or data points and :math:`{\bf m}` are the model predictions:

.. math::

    C = -2 \ln \prod_j \frac{{m_j}^{d_j}}{d_j!}\exp(-m_j).

As the variance of a Poisson distribution is equal to the mean value, no uncertainties have to
be given when using Poisson uncertainties.

Parameter constraints
---------------------
When performing a fit, some values of the model function might have already been determined in
previous experiments.
Those results and uncertainties can then be used to constrain the given parameters in a new fit.
This eliminates the need to manually propagate the uncertainties on the final fit results, as
it's now done numerically.

Parameter constraints are taken into account during the parameter estimation by adding an extra
penalty to the cost function.
The value of the penalty is determined by how well the parameter lies within its constraints.
With the cost functions used above :math:`C \equiv C_0`, the new cost function then reads as

.. math::

    C_\mathrm{total} = C_0 + C_\mathrm{constraint}

In general the penalty is given by the current parameter values :math:`\bm{p}`, the expected
parameter values :math:`\bm{\mu}` and the covariance matrix :math:`V` describing the
values and correlations between the constraints on the parameters:

.. math::

  C_\mathrm{constraint} = (\bm{p} - \bm{\mu})^T V^{-1} (\bm{p} - \bm{\mu})

For a single parameter this simplifies to:

.. math::

  C_\mathrm{constraint} = \left ( \frac{p-\mu}{\sigma} \right )^2
