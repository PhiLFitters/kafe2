kafe2 example: Gaussian approximation of Poisson distributions for large N
==========================================================================

This example is a continuation of the Poisson cost function example. While a Poisson distribution with mean N is
inherently asymmetric, it can be approximated using a symmetric Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of
sqrt(N). This approximation is bad for small N, but for large N it is accurate. In this example we show the Gaussian
approximation working well for large N.
