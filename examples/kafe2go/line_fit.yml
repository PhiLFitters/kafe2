# Example 01: Liner regression
# In this example a line f(x) = a * x + b is being fitted
# to some data points with pointwise uncertainties.

# The minimal keywords needed to perform a fit are x_data, 
# y_data, and y_errors.
# You might also want to define x_errors.

# Data is defined by lists:
x_data: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]

# For errors lists describe pointwise uncertainties.
# By default the errors will be uncorrelated.
x_errors: [0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20]

# In total the following x data will be used for the fit:
# x_0: 1.0 +- 0.05
# x_1: 2.0 +- 0.10
# x_2: 3.0 +- 0.15
# x_3: 4.0 +- 0.20

# In yaml lists can also be written out like this:
y_data:
- 2.3
- 4.2
- 7.5
- 9.4

# The above is equivalent to
# y_data: [2.3, 4.2, 7.5, 9.4]

# For errors a single float gives each data point
# the same amount of uncertainty:
y_errors: 0.4

# The above is equivalent to
# y_errors: [0.4, 0.4, 0.4, 0.4]

# In total the following y data will be used for the fit:
# y_0: 2.3 +- 0.4
# y_1: 4.2 +- 0.4
# y_2: 7.5 +- 0.4
# y_3: 9.4 +- 0.4
