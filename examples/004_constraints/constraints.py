kafe2 example: constraints
==========================

The models used to describe physical phenomena usually depend on a multitude of parameters.
However, for many experiments only one of the parameters is of actual interest to the experimenter.
Still, because model parameters are generally not uncorrelated the experimenter has to factor in
the nuisance parameters for their estimation of the parameter of interest.
Historically this has been done by propagating the uncertainties of the nuisance parameters onto
the y-axis of the data and then performing a fit with those uncertainties.
Thanks to computers, however, this process can also be done numerically by applying parameter
constraints.
This example demonstrates the usage of those constraints in the kafe2 framework.
It also demonstrates how parameters can be limited to specified intervals.

In terms of physics, this example simulates the following experiment:
A steel ball of radius r has been connected to the ceiling by a string of length l, forming a
pendulum.
Due to earth's gravity providing a restoring force this system is a harmonic oscillator.
Because of friction between the steel ball and the surrounding air the oscillator is also damped by
the viscous damping coefficient c.
The goal of the experiment is to determine the local strength of earth's gravity g.
Since the earth is shaped like an ellipsoid the gravitational pull varies with latitude:
it's strongest at the poles with g_p=9.832 m/s^2 and it's weakest at the equator with g_e=9.780
m/s^2.
For reference, at Germany's latitude g lies at approximately 9.81 m/s^2.
