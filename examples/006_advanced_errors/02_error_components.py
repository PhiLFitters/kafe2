"""
Typically, the uncertainties of the measurement data are much more complex than in the examples
discussed so far. In most cases there are uncertainties in ordinate and abscissa, and in addition to
the independent uncertainties of each data point there are common, correlated uncertainties for all
of them.

With the method add_error() or add_matrix_error() uncertainties can be specified on the 'x' and 'y'
data, either in the form of independent or correlated, relative or absolute uncertainties of all or
groups of measured values or by specifying the complete covariance or correlation matrix. All
uncertainties specified in this way are included in the global covariance matrix for the fit.

As an example, we consider measurements of a cross section as a function of the energy near a
resonance. These are combined measurement data from the four experiments at CERN's LEP accelerator,
which were corrected for effects caused by photon radiation: Measurements of the hadronic cross
section (sigma) as a function of the centre-of-mass energy (E).
