kafe2 example: x_errors
=======================

kafe2 fits support the addition of x data errors - in fact we've been using them since the very first example. To take
them into account the x errors are converted to y errors via multiplication with the derivative of the model function.
In other words, kafe2 fits extrapolate the derivative of the model function at the x data values and calculate how a
difference in the x direction would translate to the y direction. Unfortunately this approach is not perfect though.
Since we're extrapolating the derivative at the x data values, we will only receive valid results if the derivative
doesn't change too much at the scale of the x error. Also, since the effective y error has now become dependent on the
derivative of the model function it will vary depending on our choice of model parameters. This distorts our likelihood
function - the minimum of a chi2 cost function will no longer be shaped like a parabola (with a model parameter on the x
axis and chi2 on the y axis).

The effects of this deformation are explained in the non_linear_fit.py example.
